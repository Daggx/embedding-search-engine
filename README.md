# Search App

This repository contains a Python Flask app that allows users to search for subfeatures based on a text query. The search is based on cosine similarity between the query and the descriptions of subfeatures in a provided dataset, the embeddings are generated by using Eden AI API.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- pandas
- numpy
- requests
    
# Usage 

Start the Flask app by running app.py in the terminal:

python app.py

    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/search?description=<query>
    Replace <query> with your desired search query.

The app will return a JSON object containing the top 5 subfeatures with the highest cosine similarity to the query.
